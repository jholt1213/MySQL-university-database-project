# MySQL university database project
University Database Management System
MySQL | SQL

Overview
The University Database Management System is a relational database project designed to model and manage university data, including students, instructors, courses, grades, and prerequisites. The project demonstrates practical use of SQL and relational database design principles.

This project was developed as part of my Application Development and Data Analysis coursework and focuses on creating a structured database that supports real-world academic operations.

Features
- Designed a relational database schema for university operations
- Created tables for students, instructors, courses, grades, and prerequisites
- Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- Wrote SQL queries using JOINs, filters, and aggregation
- Performed INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations

Technologies Used
- MySQL
- SQL
- Git and GitHub

Database Design
The database schema was designed to enforce data integrity and support efficient querying. Key concepts include relational tables, normalization, primary and foreign keys, and constraints to maintain accurate relationships between entities.

How to Run the Project
1. Install MySQL locally or use a MySQL-compatible environment
2. Create a new database in MySQL
3. Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables and insert data
4. Execute the included SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data

What I Learned
- Designing relational databases from real-world requirements
- Writing complex SQL queries using JOINs and conditions
- Managing data integrity with constraints and relationships
- Updating and querying data efficiently in MySQL
- Documenting database structures and queries clearly

Possible Enhancements
- Add indexes to improve query performance
- Expand the schema to include additional academic features
- Integrate the database with a front-end or Java application
- Add stored procedures or views
